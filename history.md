Harvest Finance was launched by an anonymous team on September 1st, 2020.

[Contribute to this wiki!](/contribute)

# DeFi Community Stakedrop (discontinued)


To assist in initial distribution of FARM to a broad audience of DeFi power users, tokens in the DeFi community were selected to be eligible to stake their tokens in order to receive the Harvest Finance FARM token. These tokens were not deposited into the Harvest Finance
 [yield farming strategies](/strategy).
 
## Week 6

- 🔒 12 hours timelock strategy got deployed for the TUSD vault.
- 📝 2 out of the 3 security [Audits](/en/security) have been published

the community vote results : https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmQvoNCNhz5dARMgR82vFPeHAMPqMahHgsHjPYggFuAkGZ


> 🤑 The council of 69♋ was introduced. It is an initiatve to bring even more yields💰 for Harvest Finance farmers by investing in strategic early stage ventures. 
The way The council of 69♋ works is : 
> 1. A savvy community member suggest a deal and organizises a community vote to move the deal further (1000FARM votes needed)
> 2. The Harvest council of 69 performs a due dilligence and makes a decision
> 3. 💰 After a successful invesmtnt the member who suggested **the deal gets 10% in a liquidity even, while the remaining 90% go to the Profit Share pool** to be distributed among the Harvest Farmers.
