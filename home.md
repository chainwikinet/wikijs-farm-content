Yield farming can offer high interest rates, but it is becoming hard for smaller farmers to access:

![ü•ï](/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f955.svg) Transactions costs are increasing, and it's prohibitively expensive to move between farming opportunities and regularly harvest to compound your yields.

![üåΩ](/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f33d.svg) Tracking and responding to yield farming opportunities can be a full-time job.

![üçÖ](/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f345.svg) Smart contracts are hard to audit and bugs can result in lost funds.

Harvest Finance addresses this by compounding yield farming rewards automatically wherever possible to maximize yield, and managing and developing new farming strategy relentlessly.

**Harvest takes care of gas costs, APY tracking, strategy development, and auditing.**
