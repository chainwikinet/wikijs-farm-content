# Council of 69 Investment Syndicate
Harvest Finance launced the Council of 69 in October 2020, which encourages humble farmers to source early-stage projects for Harvest to invest in. Think of it as Harvest Finance's own angel investment fund!

How it works:
- Any Farmer can suggest strategic deals in the #Council-of-69 discord channel
- The Farmer creates a snapshot proposal to gather 1000 FARM votes to move the deal forward
- Basic due diligence is performed and if the deal is approved, the Harvest treasury funds the investment
- Harvest will typically fund $50,000 - $100,000 for each approved deal
- On a liquidity event, 10% of the gains are rewarded to the Farmer who brought in the deal
- The rest of the 90% are distributed to the other farmers in the profit-sharing pool

Since inception, Harvest Finance has made 4 deals through the Council of 69:
1. $50,000 in Perpetual Protocol at $0.50/PERP ([Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/harvestfi.eth/proposal/QmNf42fVYj1jnbFxrp1hQQRZH6mynH9tddBtSjY9bkpxDo); [Vesting Stream 1](https://app.sablier.finance/stream/761); [Vesting Stream 2](https://pay.sablier.finance/stream/762))
